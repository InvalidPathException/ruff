# Adding new truth data

To add new truth data, you can either add a new `<CURSOR>` directive to an
existing Python project in this directory or create a new Python project. To
create a new directory, just `cp -a existing new` and modify it as needed. Make
sure you check `completion.toml` for relevant settings.
